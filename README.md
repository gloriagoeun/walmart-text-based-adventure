# The Ultimate Walmart Text-Based Game
### created by Emily Wang, Anika Gupta & Gloria Lee for CS181G

Welcome! This repository holds the code we have written to develop a fun little text-based game.
The mission of this game is for you, as the child in Walmart, to retrieve the item placed somewhere in the store and return back to the cashier and your parents(!!) as fast as you can. Along the way, you may also encounter different aisles, so be aware to find your item! 

Hope you enjoy! Beep beep...
