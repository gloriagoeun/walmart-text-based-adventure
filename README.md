# The Ultimate Walmart Text-Based Game
### created by Emily Wang, Anika Gupta & Gloria Lee for CS181G

Welcome! This repository holds the code we have written to develop a fun little text-based game. 
The mission of this game is for you to find and grab the treasured hot sriracha! Search through the aisle mazes of Walmart to bring the Sriracha to your parents before the cashier finishes the billing. 
Beet the beep!
